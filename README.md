# PneumoniaDetection

# Project

Build an algorithm to automatically identify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at chest X-ray images. The algorithm had to be extremely accurate because lives of people is at stake.

In this project, the proposed system uses convolutional network-based model that can find out the specific abnormality in anterior chest X-ray images and effectively classify the data into pneumonia positive,  and normal classes.  The recommended system worked effectively in terms of various performance procedures and proved capable as an effective early detection system. Once attaining the data-set, the task was to then to search into possible libraries and tools that may be necessary for the project. When that was accomplished then the methods decided during the research, it was then required to implement these methods upon the data-set
